# Project Name
*TBD*

## Description
MY project is an AI-powered Spanish learning mobile application that helps users learn **real, conversational Spanish**.

Unlike traditional translation apps, this application not only translates English into standard Spanish, but also provides **slang, regional variations, and native phrasing** so users can understand how people actually speak in real-life situations.

The goal of this project is to bridge the gap between **textbook Spanish** and **real-world Spanish** using AI.
